My beloved config files
=======================
`config` dir contains them

And how to deploy 'em
======================
```bash
$ python3 install.py
```
This will link the configs according to `paths.py` (backupping the previous version of each). Edit it as you need.

You're free to choose what to do,  
thanks.
